I got this data from the Kaggle website <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabriziocominetti/the-office-lines> The direct link is not longer active, <https://www.officequotes.net/> However, the cited source to the TV show is The Office. Created by Greg Daniels, performances by Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, and John Krasinski, NBC, 2005â€“2013.
